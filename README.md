## Blink Detector🎯

## Team Name: Binary Bandits


### Team Members
- Member 1:  Anna Sara Joji - Model Engineering College

### Project Description
This is an interactive web-based project that uses the Mediapipe FaceMesh API to detect eye blinks in real-time via webcam. Each blink triggers chaotic visual and audio effects with randomized alerts and sound distortions. The project combines computer vision, JavaScript, and creative UI to simulate a humorous “chaos protocol” on blink detection.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It is very hard to live not knowing how many times you blink . 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
 Our application counts the number of times you blink your eyes when it is running anda also roasts you for blinking.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
 Languages Used:HTML, CSS, JavaScript

 Libraries used: MediaPipe FaceMesh – for real-time facial landmark detection
                 MediaPipe Camera Utils – for handling webcam input

 Tools Used:Web browser (for deployment and testing)
           AudioContext API (for sound processing and effects)
           HTML5  – for drawing video and overlays
           GitHub or VS Code (if applicable for development)


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
#  1. Clone the repository (or download the HTML file)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blink-chaos-mode.git
cd blink-chaos-mode
# 2. Open the HTML file in your browser
start index.html        
# Run
start index.html

### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
